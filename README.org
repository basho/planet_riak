* Planet Riak Planet Setup
** If you would like to setup planet and view it you will need python and the bsddb3 
module. Once installed you can run python planet.py riak/riak/config.ini to generate
the site. It will generate a static site in riak/output/
** If you just want to add a new blog edit riak/riak/config.ini and add a block similar to
this one to the bottom.

Planet
------

Planet is a flexible feed aggregator. It downloads news feeds published by
web sites and aggregates their content together into a single combined feed,
latest news first.

It uses Mark Pilgrim's Universal Feed Parser to read from RDF, RSS and Atom
feeds; and Tomas Styblo's templating engine to output static files in any
format you can dream up.

Keywords: feed, blog, aggregator, RSS, RDF, Atom, OPML, Python
